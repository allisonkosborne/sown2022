# Sown: A Seed Saver's App

An app made for all those seed collectors out there who anxiously await each seasonal harvest!

## Summary

This was my very first exploration into the world of React. Since I am an avid gardener, I immediately was struck by the idea of a simply way for users to store seed and growth information. This project was a culmination of six months of hard work in the front end portion of our year-long software engineering bootcamp.

## Technologies

- React
- CSS3
- HTML5
- Miro
- Javascript

## Functionality Includes:

- CRUD
  - CREATE user profiles, seed cards, & seed collections
  - READ user's seed profiles & seed information such as latin name, light needs, seed spacing, etc.
  - UPDATE seed cards, seed collections, & user profiles
  - DELETE seed cards & seed collections

## Future Goal

- I would love to eventually add more features such as weather predictions, soil preferences for the area of the country the user lives in, and a way to communicate the user where the seeds they are running low on are being sold in their area.

## Thank You

I would love to thank Lynn Samuelson, Sydney Noh, and Trevor Guinn for continuously offering their time, support, and wisdom throughout the journey our class has taken through front end development.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
