        <small>"Seeds are everywhere yet nobody thinks of them, tiny bundles waiting 
            to be opened. Most any seed is small enough to hide in a locket, and some 
            are so small they get latched between two teeth. They are on our forks, 
            between our cracks of sidewalks and cobblestones of streets, under trees, 
            on trees, in the produce section of the supermarket. They are in the wind, 
            rolling along the desert, in our hair, in the fur of animals, in our dogs' 
            feet." - Janisse Ray</small>

        
            <div>Now is not the time to be silent. To remain stagnant. Now is the time to 
                take our health, the health of our communities back into our sOWN hands. 
                Our future, the future of our food, a sustenance that we each partake in 
                each and every day is in danger and it is up to us to change that. With 
                each seed sown, a future is forseen. A hope is dug. And a life is changed.
